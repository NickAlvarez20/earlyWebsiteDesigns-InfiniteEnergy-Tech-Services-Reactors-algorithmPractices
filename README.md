## Project Name
Early Website Designs & Algorithm Practices
## About
This repository showcases early web development projects and algorithm practice. It includes two website prototypes: one for "Infinite Energy Tech Services," focusing on clean energy, and another for "Plasma Enterprises Inc," emphasizing advanced technology solutions. Both are built with HTML and CSS, featuring responsive layouts and basic interactivity. Additionally, the repository contains JavaScript scripts implementing algorithms, such as finding the largest sum of two numbers from a delimited string and a sliding window algorithm for binary string manipulation.
## Prerequisites
To run this project, you need:

- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox) for the website prototypes.
  
- Node.js installed for running the JavaScript algorithm scripts.
  
No additional libraries are required.
## Features
This project includes these features:

- Responsive website prototypes for "Infinite Energy Tech Services" and "Plasma Enterprises Inc" using HTML and CSS, with dropdown navigation and visual assets.
  
- JavaScript implementation of a sliding window algorithm to find the longest substring of "1"s in a binary string after flipping at most one "0".
  
- JavaScript script to parse a delimited string, identify the two largest numbers, and compute their sum.
  
- Clean and modular code structure for easy understanding and modification.
  
## Getting Started & Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:

`git clone https://github.com/NickAlvarez20/earlyWebsiteDesigns-InfiniteEnergy-Tech-Services-Reactors-algorithmPractices.git`

## Usage
Website Prototypes: Open infinite_energy_index.html or reactors_index.html in a web browser to view the respective websites.

JavaScript Algorithms: Run the scripts using Node.js from the command line:

`node test.js`

`node test1.js`


## Learning Outcomes
This project helped me:

-Develop proficiency in HTML and CSS for creating responsive and visually appealing web pages.

-Implement and understand the sliding window algorithm for efficient string processing in JavaScript.

-Master string manipulation and numerical operations in JavaScript for algorithmic problem-solving.

-Enhance skills in structuring and debugging code across web development and algorithmic contexts.
